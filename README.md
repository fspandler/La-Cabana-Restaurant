# La-Cabana-Restaurant
A website for a client that owns a Mexican Restaurant in Bakersfield, CA.


I want to include a logo in the nav bar.  I am still trying to find the best way to do this.  I think fixed positioning would be best on the nav bar, but I need to account for different screen sizes.

I want a background-cover background.  I don't have good images of the food or restaurant so I am going to have to find placeholder images.
