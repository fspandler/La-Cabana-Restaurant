# La-Cabana-Restaurant
A website for a client that owns a Mexican Restaurant in Bakersfield, CA.


The site needs to be SEO friendly and modern.

Accessible to those who are vision impaired.

I am going for images that swap in and out as you scroll down the page.

Currently the backgrounds are broken in IOS 9 Safari

Logo needs to resize on scroll

More effects on nav

Specials section needs to be added to about me

All images should be of the restaraunt and its food.
